# A chialisp unittest runner for vs code

- Requires the standard vs code unit test UI

- Run 'Run Chialisp Tests' from the command palette to discover tests.

Currently requires a .chia-env file in the directory containing the chialisp and tests
identifying the path where chialisp can be run from like this:

    {
        "PATH":"/home/me/miniconda3/envs/chia/bin"
    }
